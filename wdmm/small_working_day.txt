# Using array-like syntax, it is possible to configure 
# different parameters for consecutive simulations. For TruMan,
# we only change the simulation name and the transmission range.
# To run several simulations, change the parameter for -b when
# running one.sh.

# The ranges tested were: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300.
